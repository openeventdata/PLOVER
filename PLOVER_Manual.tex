\chapter{Introduction}

Event data in political science is a structured way of recording interactions
between political actors described in text. For instance, a researcher
encountering the sentence 

\begin{quotation}
A town in western Sudan's South Kordofan state has been recaptured by Sudanese
government forces from the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).

(AFP\_ENG\_19970408.0772)
\end{quotation}

might want to represent it as ACTOR = ``Sudanese military", EVENT = ``capture
territory", TARGET = ``SPLA", a process that can be applied over hundreds of
thousands of reports to create datasets of thousands of such events for
answering research questions.

The software to extract and categorize these events exists (see OEDA's
Petrarch2 (\url{https://github.com/openeventdata/petrarch2}), for instance), but all
event data systems require an ontology defining what actors events will be
recorded and how they will be defined.

Ontologies face difficult tradeoffs: broader groupings of event types and
actors are easier to define and implement, are easier to work with, and provide
data at a useful level of aggregation, especially analyzed globally. More
specialized and specific ontologies will sometimes be necessary for answering
certain research questions and allow more granular and subnational study, but
are more difficult to implement and may provide distinctions that are not
useful to most researchers. In the example above, should the event be
categorized as a general ``seize" event? Or a more specific "capture territory"?
Should the target be coded as a general "Sudanese rebel" or the very specific
``SPLA"? 

The best level of detail will depend on the question and resources of the
researcher.  PLOVER is a new event data ontology that choses to be more
general, easier to implement (including across languages), and at the level of
detail demanded by most existing users of event data. At the same time, PLOVER
defines and provides guidance on making ``PLOVER-compliant extensions" that will
fit into the ecosystem of tools for creating and analyzing PLOVER event data.

\section{Overview}

This manual starts with a history of PLOVER and event data for users coming from CAMEO. It then defines the top-level event types that base PLOVER defines. Along with these, it describes the ``mode'' and ``context'' fields that PLOVER uses to provide more information about the event and the circumstances in which it's occuring. Next, the manual defines codes for the actors. It then lists the standard fields in a PLOVER event record before describing ``PLOVER-complient'' extensions that researchers can use for building custom datasets.

\section{History of \textsc{PLOVER}}
\pagenumbering{arabic}

During the twentieth century, two coding frameworks dominated event data research: Charles McClelland's WEIS \citep{McClelland67,McClelland76}  and the Conflict and Peace Data Bank (COPDAB) developed by Edward Azar \citep{AzarSloan75, Azar80, Azar82}. Both were created during the Cold War and assumed a ``Westphalian-Clausewitzian'' political world in which sovereign states reacted to each other primarily through official diplomacy
and military threats. While innovative when first created, these coding systems were less than optimal for dealing with contemporary issues such as ethnic conflict, low-intensity violence, organized criminal activity, and multilateral intervention. Furthermore, \citet[pg. 177]{McClelland83} viewed WEIS as only a ``first phase''; he certainly did not anticipate that it would continue to be used, with only minor modifications, for four decades. Event coding ontologies, it seems, tend to be rather sticky.

During the early 2000s, the CAMEO framework---Conflict and Mediation Event Observations---was developed,\footnote{The canonical citation for CAMEO is \cite{SGY09}, and the most recent version of the manual is found at \texttt{http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/data.dir/cameo.html}.  The original event framework was very much the work of Deborah Gerner and \"Om\"ur Yilmaz, with contributions by various coders in the Kansas Event Data System project. The CAMEO manual contains an extended discussion of the issues considered in transitioning from WEIS to CAMEO. Additional details on the development of the automated coding underlying CAMEO can be found in \cite{Schrodt06TPM} or \texttt{http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/utilities.dir/KEDS.History.0611.pdf}. } and originally was intended merely to support an NSF-funded project on the study of inter-state conflict mediation. Instead, it was gradually adopted as a ``next generation'' coding scheme, notably for the DARPA-funded Integrated Conflict Early Warning System (ICEWS) project \citep{OBrien10} because it corrected some of the long-recognized ambiguities in WEIS and COPDAB, and was explicitly designed both for automated coding and for the detailed coding of sub-state actors. 

As event data came into wider use in the 2010s, several problems with the CAMEO standard---which had never been intended to be a ``standard'' in the first place---became apparent. These included

\begin{itemize}
\item Almost all applications of CAMEO event data aggregated to either the 2-digit ``cue category'' or the even more general ``quad category.''\fn{Verbal cooperation, material cooperation, verbal conflict, and material conflict, with these usually defined exclusively using the 2-digit categories.} No one used all 260 codes.
\item Nonetheless, users unfamiliar with the data generating process for automated event coding sometimes assumed every code had been equally well implemented.
\item The complexity of CAMEO made it almost impossible to generate a comprehensive set of ``gold standard records'' and human coders had difficulty agreeing on how to consistently distinguish many of the subcategories: this became particularly apparent as efforts were made to implement CAMEO in Spanish and Arabic.
\item Newer coding systems provided information such as geolocation and named-entity extraction beyond the original date-source-target-event format and there was no standard for how to include these in the data.
\item The continuing emphasis on coding substate activities demonstrated the need for either new categories or contexts to deal, for example, with criminal activity and events such as natural disaster, elections, and parliamentary behavior.
\end{itemize}

Predictably, because of these and other issues, by 2015 CAMEO was beginning to ``fork'': both the ICEWS data implementing CAMEO in the BBN/Raytheon \txt{ACCENT} coder \\ (\url{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/icews}) and the Phoenix data implementing it using the Open Event Data Alliance (OEDA) \txt{PETRARCH-2} coder  (\url{http://phoenixdata.org/}) differed significantly in some of the CAMEO categories compared to the original implementation in the University of Kansas \txt{TABARI} coder. 

To address these concerns, an informal group of academic, government and private sector producers and users of event data met and circulated drafts during the fall of 2016 to develop a new, simplified and more flexible event data specification to replace CAMEO: the end product of those deliberations is the document you are reading. The major changes are the following

\begin{itemize}
\item A set of standardized names (``fields'') for JSON (\url{http://www.json.org/}) records are specified for both the core event data fields and for extended information such as geolocation and extracted texts; most of these fields are optional and where available we use existing specifications, for example the \url{http://geonames.org} geographical location field names, ISO-3166 country identifiers and ISO-8601 date and time formats, and \textit{Social Conflict Analysis Database} (SCAD) protest contexts.
\item Only the 2-digit event ``cue categories'' have been retained from CAMEO: our hope is that these are sufficiently broad and distinct that one can achieve a reasonably high level of human inter-coder agreement---hence ``verifiable''---on the coding categories, and that these distinctions can be consistently implemented, across all categories, in the automated system. These are defined in greater detail than they were in WEIS and CAMEO.
\item The CAMEO 01 and 02 categories dealing with comments have been eliminated.\fn{Ironically, this reverses a decision McClelland belatedly made---and later regretted---in the WEIS specification in the 1960s.}
\item The CAMEO 08 ``YIELD'' category has been split into verbal (\plcat{CONCEDE}) and material (\plcat{RETREAT}) components. 
\item A new category has been added for criminal behavior.
\item Much of the detail 3- and 4-digit details is now delegated to an optional $mode$ field (as well as $context$): see Section \ref{ssec:ecm} for further discussion of this.  \item A ``context'' field is available, along with standard values, to handle contexts such as disease, natural disaster, elections, parliamentary processes and cyber-security.\fn{In contrast to the Integrated Data for Events Analysis (IDEA) \cite{BBOJT03} system which was in use in the early 2000s, we are not treating disease and disaster as events with targets, instead they are a context within which other activity occurs. This, interestingly, echoes an approach used in COPDAB but not retained by WEIS and CAMEO.}
\item The complexity of substate actor codes has been limited, and the allowable substate modifiers have been substantially simplified. 
\item Standard optional fields have been defined for some categories, and the ``target'' is optional in some categories.
\item We have converted all of the examples in the CAMEO manual to an initial set of English-language ``gold standard records'' for validation purposes---these files can be found at\\ \url{https://github.com/openeventdata/PLOVER/blob/master/PLOVER_GSR_CAMEO.txt}---and we expect to both expand this corpus and extend it to  at least Spanish and Arabic cases. This documentation includes the English-language gold standard records from the CAMEO manual.
\end{itemize}

Because PLOVER is generally a simplification of CAMEO---the new \textsf{CRIME} category is the one exception---our expectation is that it will be relatively easy to transition the existing CAMEO-based coders into this by simply collapsing the two- and three-digit categories; a similar simple recoding will allow older CAMEO-coded data sets to be converted to their PLOVER equivalents. The standardization of the JSON field names---as well as adoption of JSON as the data interchange format---will allow the development of general-purpose utilities that can work with all formats, in contrast with the current proliferation of incompatible CSV and tab-delimited formats.

\section{Issues we will not be addressing}\label{sec:nothing}

In the discussions leading to the development of PLOVER, several additional open issues were raised that we have decided to remain agnostic on:

\begin{description}
\item[Temporal markup:] This is emerging as a major issue, particular among users who are interested in the long-standing objective of automated chronology generators. While there are some significant efforts on this in the NLP community---\url{http://www.timeml.org/}---we don't feel we currently have the experience required to make recommendations.
\item[Number of events per sentence:] Everyone in the community now has a collection of sentences that could be interpreted as containing anywhere from one to a half-dozen or more events. While this is nominally an ontological issue---``the branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being''---the ability to resolve it will be highly dependent on specific parser/coder implementations, so we're leaving it at that level. Same for sentence-level vs paragraph- or article-level coding.
\item[De-duplication:] There is no consensus on this beyond noting that the widely-used ``one-a-day filtering'' is probably not a good idea,\fn{See \texttt{http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/papers.dir/Schrodt.TAD-NYU.EventData.pdf}} and it is a topic where there is currently active research and experimentation, so we're leaving it alone.
\end{description}

As a more general caveat, we would very much encourage anyone who is using a PLOVER-coded data set to look carefully at the software used to implement it, particularly with regard to
\begin{itemize}
\item The motivations (and resources available) for producing the data, which will often provide information on how much attention was given to various categories. 
\item If the coder is dictionary-based, the event and actor dictionaries if these are available. If the coder is classifer-based, the training cases if these are available.
\item Recall/precision tradeoffs and how these play out across different news sources: we are not aware of any existing parser/coder that is optimal for everything from a Reuters story written and edited by people trained at Oxford to a BBC radio transcript from a static-filled French radio report out of Goma, DRC quickly translated into English by a non-native speaker of either language.
\end{itemize}

OEDA was founded on the principle that there is no ``one data set to rule them all'': different implementations will have different strengths. PLOVER is at least as much a data-interchange format as a coding ontology, and should simplify the ability of the research to check the robustness of results by looking at multiple independent coding efforts. Do it!



\section{Why ``PLOVER''?}

Plovers (\textit{Charadriidae}) are a globally-distributed family of short-billed gregarious wading birds who spend their lives frantically poking through endless stretches of sand and muck trying to find something of interest. It is difficult to imagine a better analogy to the process of coding event data.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Event Categories}

\textbf{General observation (pas 2016-10-19):} I've included separate $mode$ and/or $context$ lists for \plcat{CONSULT, MOBILIZE, CRIME, COERCE, PROTEST} and \plcat{ASSAULT} but in fact we could probably usefully include them for almost all of the categories. In contrast to CAMEO, these are optional, but they do provide a systematic way of providing more detail. However, there is still too much detail specific to mediation in here.

\section{Event, Mode, and Context}\label{ssec:ecm}

As noted above, most\fn{``most'' because some of the details coded in CAMEO, particularly those dealing specifically with mediation, have been eliminated.} of the detail found in the 3- and 4-digit categories of CAMEO is now found in the $mode$ and  $context$ fields in PLOVER. More generally, PLOVER takes the general purpose ``events'' of CAMEO (as well as the earlier WEIS, IDEA and COPDAB ontologies) and splits these into three components: generally ``$event-mode-context$'' corresponds to ``$what-how-why$.'' We anticipate at least four advantages to this
\begin{enumerate}
\item The three ``$what-how-why$''components are now distinct, whereas various CAMEO subcategories inconsistently used the $how$ and $why$ to distinguish between subcategories.
\item We are probably increasing the ability of classifiers---as distinct from parser/coders---to assign $mode$ and $context$ compared to their ability to assign subcategories.
\item In initial experiments, it appears that the  approach \textit{much} easier for humans to code than the hierarchical structure of CAMEO because a human coder can hold most of the relevant categories working memory (well, that and a few tables easily displayed on a screen)\footnote{PLOVER coding may also be easier because everything in the $event-mode-context$ coding uses words, not numerical codes, so coders will probably be using the parts of the brain (Broca's area) which are specialized for processing words. No known specialized cognitive facility exists for handling some 250 2-to-4-digit codes.}
\item Because the words used in differentiate $mode$ and $context$ are generally very basic, translations of the coding protocols into languages other than English is likely to be easier than translating the subcategory descriptions found in CAMEO. 
\end{enumerate}

While both $mode$ and $context$ will usually take a single value, in some instances multiple values will be appropriate and this is allowed (and preferable to generating multiple events from a single text). Both fields are optional, and unless an ``other'' category is explicitly specified---this has been provided in a couple of the event categories to provide compatibility with other coding systems---if no existing values seem appropriate, the field should be left null, though perhaps with some details provided in the $comment$ field, particularly when the record is generated using human coding.

In general, verbal activities only have a $context$ since their $mode$ is just ``verbal.'' The exceptions are \plcat{CONSULT} where the $mode$ indicates how the consultation was done, and \plcat{THREATEN} where the $mode$ indicates what action is being threatened. 

We anticipate that in general---and consistent with earlier event coding schemes---it will be possible to code $mode$ from the same sentence used to code the event. $context$, in contrast, will often need to be coded at the paragraph- or document-level: this differs from earlier automated coding, though probably is similar to human-coded data such as COPDAB and BCOW where $context$-like fields were coded.


\section{AGREE}

Agree to, offer, promise, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to cooperate.  All cooperative actions reported in future tense are also taken to imply intentions. 

\subsection{Requires target: No}

\subsection{Supplementary fields: None}

\bigskip  

\section{CONSULT}

All consultations and meetings: this includes visiting and hosting visits, as well as meeting at a neutral location, and consultation by phone or other media. Other useful keywords: ``Holding talks'' and ``discussions'', ``negotiations, bargaining, or discussions''. See the discussion in Section \ref{sec:recip} on the treatment of actors in \plcat{CONSULT} events.

\subsection{Requires target: No}

\plcat{CONSULT} events where there is no clear distinction between whether an actor is hosting or visiting, all participants are coded as source actors.

\section{SUPPORT}

Initiate, resume, improve, or expand diplomatic, non-material cooperation; express support for, commend, approve policy, action, or actor. This event form is a verbal act. Use this code only for political, diplomatic, and non-material support, including recognition of newly independent states, new governments that might have come to power through unconventional means, and initiation of diplomatic ties with an entity for the first time, as are actions which ratify, sign, or finalize an agreement or treaty.
 
\subsection{Requires target: No}

\subsection{Potential ambiguities}

\begin{itemize}
\item Formal pardons and amnesties of arrested persons should be coded as \plcat{CONCEDE}; the actual release  or exchange of prisoners should be coded as \plcat{RETREAT}.

\item Expressions of regret or remorse for an action or situation should be coded as \plcat{CONCEDE}.

\item Promises to sign or ratify agreements and treaties are coded as \plcat{AGREE}

\item Military cooperation or defense should be coded as \plcat{COOPERATE} with a \txt{military} $context.$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supplementary fields: None}

\newpage

\section{CONCEDE}

This covers verbal concessions which have no immediate material consequences, including promised of future concessions, including easing of administrative or legal restrictions on persons and organizations, remove curfews, suspending protests, declarations (but not implementations) of ceasefires and withdrawals from territory.

\plcat{CONCEDE}, like the verbal components CAMEO/WEIS predecessor \plcat{YIELD}, is inherently problem since many concessions deal with promises that certain things will \ti{not} happen, or will happen in the distant future (e.g. many policy changes). So, for example, the lifting of a curfew is, effectively, a promise that people will not be arrested for violating the curfew, which itself is not an event. We're treating such concessions as verbal rather than material even though sometimes they have material consequences, e.g. people coming out in the streets after a curfew is lifted. But only if they believe the government. As noted in Section \ref{sec:nothing}, PLOVER isn't really set up to deal with these levels of event dependence. 

\begin{comment}

pas 2006-10-20

I split CAMEO YIELD but and most of the old categories break out pretty easily but I'm still not quite sure the following belongs here

\item Yield by relinquishing political power, either via voluntary concessions or involuntary surrenders. Use this code when source surrenders power after being challenged through legitimate institutional channels (e.g. elections) or other coercive strategies (e.g. military coups). The target can either be the challenger(s) or the country as a whole.

How does this interaction with the hex codings of negative events in PETR 2?

\end{comment}

\subsection{Requires target: No}

\subsection{Supplementary fields: Use at least a few of the CAMEO cases?}


\bigskip
%\newpage  

\section{COOPERATE}

Initiate, resume, improve, or expand \ti{mutual} material cooperation or exchange, including

\begin{itemize}
\item Initiate, resume, improve, or expand economic exchange or cooperation.

\item Military exchanges such as joint military games and maneuvers.

\item Cooperation on judicial matters, such as extraditions and war crimes.

\item Voluntary exchanges or sharing of intelligence and other significant information .

\end{itemize}

\noindent \plcat{COOPERATE} is distinguished from \plcat{AID} because the activity is generally understood to directly benefit both parties, whereas  \plcat{AID} is understood to primarily benefit only the recipient. 

\subsection{Requires target: Yes}

\subsection{Supplementary fields: None? Or rely on the general context codes?}


\newpage

\section{AID}

All provisions of providing material aid whose material benefits primarily accrue to the recipient. Examples include: 

\begin{itemize}

\item Monetary aid and financial guarantees, grants, gifts and credit.

\item Military and police assistance including arms and personnel.

\item Humanitarian aid such as emergency assistance.

\item Asylum, both to persons in its territories (territorial asylum) and diplomatic asylum on the premises of an embassy.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requires target: Yes}

\subsection{Supplementary fields: None? Or capture the monetary, manpower, and magnitudes from the context?}


\bigskip  


\section{RETREAT}

\plcat{RETREAT} covers any events---not just military ``retreat'' from territory---which have an immediate (not simply promised) material consequences, such as the release of prisoners and hostages, repatriation of refugees, the return of  confiscated property, allowing the entry of observers, peacekeepers, or humanitarian workers, disarming, observing a ceasefire or otherwise ending active conflicts, and, of course, a military retreat from, or ceding, territory. \plcat{RETREAT} also covers resignations of government officials.

\subsection{Requires target: No}

\subsection{Supplementary fields: Almost certainly need some}


\bigskip  


\section{INVESTIGATE}

All investigations, including those of historical cases. Examples include investigations of  criminal activity (theft, killing, etc) and corruption, human rights abuses, war crime, and violations of basic freedoms, military activities such as violations of ceasefire, seizures, and invasions.

\subsection{Requires target: No}

\subsection{Supplementary fields: None?}

\newpage  

\section{DEMAND}

All demands and orders. Demands are stronger or more forceful than a request or appeal---which is not coded in PLOVER---and potentially carry more serious repercussions, although not as much as threats. Coding will need to rely primarily on the language used by reporters to make this distinction.  All demands are verbal acts. 

Examples from the CAMEO manual include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Demand that target engages in some form of material or economic exchange or assistance.
\item Demand that target engages in or expands military relations or assistance.
\item Demand that target engages in or expands cooperation in judicial matters.
\item Demand that target exchanges intelligence or information.
\item Demand expansion of diplomatic ties or non-tangible support on particular policies.
\item Demands by refugees to be let into the territories of other countries (which should be coded as targets) and asylum demands all fit here. These are not necessarily verbal acts; refugees could be actively seeking shelter or refuge in target countries or regions.
\item Demand that the target provides military protection or peacekeeping forces  for itself or on behalf of another party.
\item Demand for elections, changes in leadership or regime, or constitutional/institutional/policy change.
\item Demand provision or expansion of social, political, or other rights, as well as demands for provision of compensation for previously violated rights.
\item Require, demand major institutional, constitutional, or regime change.
\item Demands for fundamental changes in the political system (e.g. democratization) as well as more limited institutional changes (e.g. changing electoral law).
\item Demand that target relaxes administrative restrictions.
\item Demand that target stops political protest activities.
\item Demand that target releases persons (e.g. prisoners, hostages) or property.
\item Demand that target lifts or eases economic sanctions, boycott, or embargo.
\item Demand that target allow access to international actors, such as observers, humanitarian agencies, and peacekeeping forces.
\item Demand that target stops fighting or takes measures to ease military conflict or tension, for example ceasefires, military withdrawals, and demobilization.
\item Order party(ies) to meet, negotiate; this event form can be initiated by either the adversaries or other third parties.
\item Order parties to a conflict to reach a settlement, agreement, or resolution of conflict. 
\item Demand that a third party mediates a conflict or that adversaries accept mediation of another party.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Requires target: No}


\subsection{Potential ambiguities}

\begin{itemize}
\item This category only applies to verbal demands: demands that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded as \plcat{PROTEST}.
\item When one or more parties to a conflict call for ending the conflict, that is taken to be an expression of intent on the part of that source actor and is thus coded as \plcat{AGREE}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supplementary fields: None? -- obviously a lot of \ti{context} fodder in that list...}

\newpage  


\section{DISAPPROVE}

Express disapprovals, objections, and complaints; condemn, decry a policy or an action; criticize, defame, denigrate responsible parties.

Examples from the CAMEO manual include:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Allege, charge the target with, or blame for engaging in crime or corruption.
\item Allege, charge the target with, or blame for human rights violations, such as arbitrary detentions for prosecutions, torture, and slavery.
\item Allege, charge the target with, or blame for initiating hostilities or engaging in questionable or unjustifiable military actions such as violations of ceasefire, or with war crimes.
\item Allege, charge the target with, or blame for spying, espionage, or treason.
\item Solicit other parties to take actions against the target.
\item Written and institutionalized protests, appeals, and all petition drives and recalls. % Do we want the word protest here?
\item Sue, file civil or criminal lawsuit at domestic or international courts. Source must be the plaintiff or the state, and target must be the defendant.
\item Find guilty or liable at a court of law. Source must be the court in question, which could be domestic or international, and target must be the defendant. This event form refers typically to rulings against non-individuals, where imprisonment is not an issue. When individuals are found guilty and are therefore detained, use \plcat{COERCE} instead.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requires target: No}

\subsection{Supplementary fields: None?}

\newpage  


\section{REJECT}

All rejections and refusals. Examples from the CAMEO manual include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Refuse to engage in or expand material exchange. Note the difference between refusing to establish or expand material cooperation and reducing or eliminating existing ties \plcat{SANCTION}.
\item Refuse to engage in or expand economic ties.
\item Use this code for rejections of mutual economic exchange, such as trade and investment; rejection to provide financial aid (or cancel debt) is coded as CAMEO 1221 instead.
\item Refuse to engage in or expand military ties.
\item Use this code for rejections of mutual military exchange; rejection to provide military aid is coded as \plcat{SANCTION} instead.
\item Refuse to engage in or expand cooperation in judicial matters, including  extraditions or other matters pertaining to legal proceedings.
\item Refuse to engage in or expand cooperation in intelligence or information sharing.
\item Refuse to extend financial, military or humanitarian assistance. Refusals to provide shelter or refuge should also be coded here. 
\item Refuse to provide peacekeeping forces or other form of military protection;; refusals by adversaries to grant access to peacekeepers.
\item Refuse to change leadership or relinquish power.

\section{THREATEN}

All threats, coercive or forceful warnings with serious potential repercussions. Threats are typically verbal acts. Examples from the CAMEO manual include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Threats to reduce or eliminate provision of material assistance---economic, military, humanitarian, and peacekeeping.

\item Threaten to restrict normal economic interactions by imposing sanctions, boycotts, or embargoes.

\item Threaten to reduce or formally sever ties. Non-force threats to declare independence, resign, withdraw diplomats, reduce or break diplomatic ties, etc.\ are all coded here.

\item Threaten to impose or expand non-force administrative restrictions and penalties not otherwise specified.

\item Threaten to impose or expand restrictions on fundamental freedoms, such as freedoms of speech, expression, and assembly. 
\item Threaten to ban political activities of particular parties or individuals.
\item Threatened with imprisonment or other measures of repression.

\item Threaten to enforce a deadline beyond which inhabitants of an area are not permitted to be on the streets or in public places.

\item Threaten with suspending certain given rights or the whole constitution by imposing state of emergency or military rule.

\item Threaten to mobilize or engage in actions of political dissent such as protest demonstrations, hunger strikes, strikes or boycotts, physical obstructions into buildings or areas, and riots.

\item Threaten to break-up or withdraw from discussion, negotiation, or meeting.

\item Threaten to reduce or stop international intervention by expelling or withdrawing observers, humanitarian agencies, peacekeepers, etc.

\item Threats by international agencies to withdraw their involvement as well as threats by host countries to expel such actors are coded here. 
\item Threaten dissidents with forcible subjugation.
\item Threats to imprison as well as to use force to clamp down on opposition activities are coded here. 
\item Threaten to prevent entry into and/or exit from a territory using military measures.
\item Threaten to occupy, seize control of the whole or part of a territory.  This event form is typically a verbal act and is distinct from \plcat{FIGHT}, which refers to military occupations that have been or are being carried out.
\item Threaten to use violence, including terrorist activities

\item Give a final warning, ultimate demand or order, the rejection of which carries the risk of some form of retaliation by the party issuing the ultimatum.

\section{CRIME}

\plcat{CRIME} events are non-political actions which are considered crimes in the jurisdiction where they occur: Table \ref{tab:crimemode} lists the common examples. This category is not intended for the coding of acts of civil disobedience, revolt and other activities which, while criminal from the perspective of the government, are primarily political in nature.

\subsection{Requires target: No}

\subsection{Potential ambiguities}

\begin{itemize}
\item There is often a great deal of ambiguity as to whether some activities are criminal or political: for example, confiscatory activities by a weak militarized group with little local support. Usually such distinctions will not be apparent at the sentence---or even article---level and need to be resolved elsewhere in the analysis, for example by the classification of the actor.

\section{SANCTION}

All reductions in normal, routine, or cooperative relations not otherwise specified. Note that this is not confined to formal ``sanctions''---\plcat{SANCTION} was just the best word we could find for WEIS and CAMEO's ``REDUCE RELATIONS''

Examples from the CAMEO manual include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Curtail, decrease, break, or terminate diplomatic exchange.

\item Cancellation of meetings, withdrawal, or expulsion of diplomats and termination of other diplomatic activities 

\item Reductions or terminations of aid not otherwise specified.
\item Decrease or terminate provision of economic, military or humanitarian aid.
\item Stop or restrict commercial or other material exchange as a form of protest or punishment.
\item Terminate discussions, negotiations. Use this event form to code failed negotiations and walk-outs, as well as other disruptions of planned negotiations. Note that the termination can be either unilateral or bi/multi-lateral.
\item Terminate mediation activities.
\item Terminate the presence of groups or organizations: this covers both expulsions by host authorities and withdrawals by guest groups or organizations, as well as diplomats are withdrawn or expelled. .   \item Terminate the deployment or presence of peacekeeping forces, inspectors or other observers.
\item Terminate the presence of aid agencies or other non-governmental organizations helping civilians.

\subsection{Requires target: Yes}

\subsection{Potential ambiguities}

\begin{itemize}
\item Expulsions or deportations of individuals---typically a legal matter---are coded as \plcat{COERCE}

\section{MOBILIZE}

All military or police moves that fall short of the actual use of force. This category is different from \plcat{ASSAULT} and \plcat{FIGHT}, as they refer to uses of force, while military posturing falls short of actual use of force and is typically a demonstration of military capabilities and readiness. \plcat{MOBILIZE} is also distinct from \plcat{THREAT} in that the latter refers merely to threats, is typically verbal, and does not involve any activity that is undertaken to demonstrate military power. Source actors  are not necessarily militaries affiliated with states but any organized armed groups. Targets are actors against whom the source mobilizes its military capabilities in a threatening manner if that is clear, but a group may mobilize with no specific target stated.

\section{DOCUMENT}

\plcat{DOCUMENT} ``events'' are means of including some internal documentation in the data set while still allowing the file to be read as a single JSON object: this is similar to the \plcat{DOC} event used in the data sets produced by TABARI. Generally these records will only use the $citation$, $publication$, $coder$, $version$, $dateCoded$, and $comment$ fields: detailed documentation should be placed in a separate file with a reference, typically, in the $comment$ field. However, the specifics of the use of this field are left to the data provider. \plcat{DOCUMENT} events should be skipped when doing statistical analyses of the data.

\chapter{Actor and Sector Codes}

CAMEO employed a hierarchical actor coding structure based on 3-character coding elements which allowed nearly unlimited complexity and, depending on the exact coding system, could be resolved down to the identity of individual groups or individuals. As with the event codes, typically only the first two or three of these elements were used. ICEWS modified this somewhat, while preserving most of the sub-state differentiations as ``sectors''---the terminology we've adopted here over the CAMEO/IDEA ``agents''---but also provided a very substantial amount of complexity at the sub-sector level.

As with the events, the PLOVER specification seeks to pare this down to the most commonly used actors and agent/sectors, while retaining the possibility of more specific information. In place of the pages of actor and agent specification found in the CAMEO manual, PLOVER has four rules:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The actor code---$source/target$---is either an ISO-3166-alpha-3 code or one of a small number of non-state codes
\item The sector code is a 3-character primary code with one optional secondary code
\item Identifiers for individual persons or organizations are coded in the $*Identifer$ and/or $*Text$ fields
\item The $*Info$ JSON object is used for additional information beyond what can be coded in the sector secondary modifer\fn{In other words, one item of information---typically it is religion, ethnicity, or position---can be coded in the tertiary code, but only one: this handles virtually all of the current use-cases we know of.} such as religion, ethnicity, official position, etc
\end{enumerate}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{2-element sector codes?? You're going  to regret that, right?}

Yeah, probably. The primary motivation for this is differentiating multiple sub-state militarized groups (REB) which in the current environment are typically distinguished by either religion (Central African Republic), ethnicity (Somalia, South Sudan, Myanmar) or a combination (Iraq, Syria). Allowing a second element in the sector codes allows one to do this without using the more elaborate $*Info$ object. But we're not allowing sector codes to handle something of the complexity of ``Iranian-backed Bosnian Serb militia.''\fn{Such a group existed in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s: we're guessing it was rather small.}
\end{quote}

\section{Actor codes}

For nation-states and other entities for whom an ISO-3166 code\fn{\txt{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_3166-1\_alpha-3}} exists\fn{For example, dependencies such as the \AA land Islands}, use the alpha-3 code. Use the codes in Table \ref{tab:nonstate} for non-state actors:

\begin{table}[htp]

\subsection{Sector Secondary Code}

We are leaving this open, but for purposes of standardizing, would point the user to the following resources we have found useful

\begin{description}
\item[CAMEO Religious Codes:] This is a very large hierarchically-organized scheme for coding virtually all religions and religious-movements that could be identified ca. 2010. \LaTeX~and PDF versions of this are available at \url{https://github.com/openeventdata/PLOVER}
\item[CAMEO Ethnic Codes:] This was CAMEO's effort to provide a uniform set of ethnicity codes based on  two primary sources: (1) the International Organization for Standardization's (ISO) Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages\\ (\url{ISO-639.2; http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/}) and (2) the Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) dataset 3.1 (\url{http://www.epr.ucla.edu/}). \LaTeX and PDF versions of this are available at \url{https://github.com/openeventdata/PLOVER.}

%\item[XXX Religious Codes:] This is a stub for another, shorter religious codes framework I'm still trying to track down

\item[ICEWS Sectors:] The file \txt{icews.sectors.20140112.csv} provides three-level hierarchy of sectors which could be used as an alternative to the specification here; \txt{    
icews.agents.20140112.csv} associates these with common names or noun-phrases found in news reports:\\ \url{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/28118}

\item[PETRARCH Agents:] PETRARCH project agents file, which was assembled from earlier KEDS project TABARI files, WordNet (\url{https://wordnet.princeton.edu/}), CIA World Leaders and an assortment of other sources.\\ \url{https://github.com/openeventdata/petrarch2/blob/master/petrarch2/data/dictionaries/Phoenix.agents.txt}
\end{description}

\subsection{Compound and Reciprocal Actors}\label{sec:recip}

Most CAMEO-based coders dealt with compound actors---``The United States and France accused Russia\ldots''---by generating multiple events: this example would generate two events of the form
\begin{verbatim}
    USA  RUS  112
    FRA  RUS  112
\end{verbatim}
This approach, however, gets very problematic in the not-uncommon situation where an alliance is involved and is expanded to all of its constituent members: a single reference to the G20 expands to at least twenty events, and a \textit{meeting} of the G20, generating reciprocal events, expands to 380 events, which is one of the reasons ``consult'' events are so frequent in CAMEO-coded data.

In PLOVER, compound actors generate a single source or target, but with multiple members: the source and target are a list of actors rather than a single actor. Depending on the application, a user might expand this to multiple events with single actor codes following the earlier conventions, but the initial coding uses the list.

PLOVER also uses actor lists to deal with reciprocal events. In CAMEO, a meeting ``President Obama met with Japanese Prime Minister Abe at the White House"" generated two events
\begin{verbatim}
    JAP  USA  042
    USA  JAP  043
\end{verbatim}
where 042 and 043 are the CAMEO codes for "visit" and "host" respectively.\footnote{This example optimistically assumes the coding system was clever enough to recognize the significance of the phrase ``at the White House.''} While the PLOVER \plcat{CONSULT} mode provides for a host/visit distinction, this is not required. In such instances, all of the actors are considered as the source and no target is included.

In \plcat{ASSAULT} events, reciprocal violence---as distinct from one-sided violence---is handled in a similar fashion, with both parties as $source$ actors: this applies in any event where both sides are using force, even if one side ``started it''\footnote{An assessment often as not contested anyway.} One-sided violence, such as assassinations or police firing on demonstrators, will have the perpetrator as the $source$ and the victims as $target.$

\chapter{JSON Data Fields}

In keeping with OEDA's founding aversion to any efforts at creating ``one data set to rule them all,'' almost all of the fields listed below are optional: the objective of this part of the specification is mostly to provide a standard set of field names to simplify the merging and reuse of datasets. Despite the apparent complexity here, note that the only required field we have added to ``event data classic'' is the $id$ identifier, so the simplest form of an event record would look like
\begin{verbatim}
{
    "id" : "PHOXv1-20160724-0042",
    "date" : 2016-07-24",
    "source" : [{"code":"USA"}],
    "target" : [{"code":"CAN"}],
    "event" : "AGREE"
}
\end{verbatim}

Except in the small number of cases where a standard format is specified, the content of the field is left open, and in particular ``number'' should be interpreted as ``number or code'': for example instead of providing the number of individuals killed, a dataset might use a set of categories giving ranges. Similarly, categories such as $context$ can take multiple values: typically your end users would probably be happiest if these were formatted using a JSON ``array'' structure---comma-delimited in square brackets---but this is not assumed. Responsibility for handling these details is left to the data provider and users.

Providers should feel free to include named fields beyond those provided hence---hence the absence of any generic field names like $extra1$, $extra2$ in the standard---but if you are coding or extracting information that corresponds to one of the existing fields, please use that name.

\noindent \textbf{Notes:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The identifier should be unique within the data set; it is the responsibility of the user to reconcile identifiers across data sets
\item ISO 8601 allows a number of different formats for times depending on the level of detail. A string of the form \texttt{date + `T' + time} should yield an ISO-8601 datetime.
\item  $mode$ and $context$ fields can have multiple entries; they do not need to resolve to a single value.
\item  This can be used to create a common reference across multiple related events, demonstrations in multiple locations organized by the same group.
\item \color{red}{PTB Question: Should there also be lat and lon for any geolocation of the eventLoc?} \color{blue}{PAS: eventLoc has that inside the location object}

\item Geonames, alas, uses ISO-3166-alpha-2 rather than the more mnemonic alpha-3 codes used in most event data work. For purposes 
of compatibility, we're suggesting retaining this in the ``country code'' field but adding a ``cc3'' field (not found in geonames) for
alpha-3 codes.

\end{table}%

\noindent \textbf{Notes:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item For unconventional weapons, the  $mode$ in the FIGHT record would be set to ``Unconventional.'' In PLOVER, mass expulsions, killings and ethnic cleansing (CAMEO 201, 202, and 203) are a pattern of events, not a single event.
\item Generally, everything at the 3- and 4-digit level should simply be reduced to the 2-digit cue category and converted accordingly. Depending on your specific application, you might want to make some exceptions to this---for example a CAMEO  ``015: Acknowledge or claim responsibility'' might be considered AGREE and a CAMEO ``016: Deny responsibility'' might be considered REJECT---but we are not making general recommendations on this. Except to suggest that for the benefit of those trying to replicate your work, you carefully document any such decisions.

    \section{Actor Coding Cheatsheet}

{\Large Sarah Stacey}, \\ KEDS Project Coder
\bigskip

\noindent 2010
\bigskip

\begin {itemize}
\item Underscore, underscore, underscore.

\item Never use ``a'', ``an'', or ``the'' in the beginning of an entry in the actors dictionary.

\item When entering just a name (e.g. \texttt{KOFI\_ANNAN}) without a job title (specifying organization, ethnicity, etc.), always date restrict! The entry \texttt{U.N.\_SECRETARY\_GENERAL\_KOFI\_ANNAN} does not require a date restriction, because you can assume he is \texttt{[IGOUNO]} by definition.

\item Do not use only first or last names such as \texttt{ROBERTS} or \texttt{ABDULLAH} that can be confused with other actors. In 99\% of cases, you need to use the full name and/or attach the title (for example, \texttt{SAUDI\_KING\_ABDULLAH}).

\item Remember to include all information given.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
GOVERNMENT_OWNED_BUSINESS [~GOVBUS]
MILITARY_COURT [~MILJUD]
STATE_OWNED_NEWS [~GOVMED]
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\item Use your judgment on when one identity supersedes another.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
AMERICAN_U.N._OBSERVER [IGOUNO]
FIJIAN_PEACEKEEPING_SOLDIER [IGOPKO].
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\item Don't confuse ethnicity with territory. Be careful with [PAL] vs. [PSE], and [ARB] vs. [MEA].

\item Don't be fooled when the title is not in the code.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ARAB_ALLY_JORDAN [JOR]
ARAB_CAPITALS [MEA]
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\item Any political party should be opposition or government with date restrictions. This also goes for Labor and Communist parties (not \texttt{[~LAB]} OR \texttt{[CMN]}).

\item When entering nouns and adjectives, only add an ``s'' if necessary. For example, never add ``negotiations'', but rather ``negotiation'' so that you do not have add it again when the singular form comes up.

\item Never inject your own bias.

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
EGYPTIAN_FUNDAMENTALIST_GROUP  [EGYMOSRAD] ;*** 7/17/01
\end{verbatim}
This entry assumes that all fundamentalist groups in Egypt are also Islamic.

\item There are some verbs that innately express intent such as plan, prepare, promise, pledge, vow etc. But most all others, like ``provide'' or ``sign'', need a \texttt{WILL}, \texttt{IS\_TO\_} etc. in order to code in the \texttt{[030]}'s to differentiate betweens events that have taken place and those that have not. Instead of individualized codes for each, use brackets to cover your bases:


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ACCEPT
- { WOULD | IS_TO_ | WILL } *  MEDIATION [039]
\end{verbatim} \texttt{(Express intent to mediate)}
\end{quote}

\item When there is a formal agreement between two actors that describes a specific form of cooperation, always be as specific as possible, instead of always coding it as \texttt{[057:057]}.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
SIGN
- % * MILITARY ACCORD  [062:062]
\end{verbatim}
It is most accurate to say the parties are engaging in military cooperation.
\end{quote}

\item Only use the code \texttt{[139] (give ultimatum)} if cannot you specify another type of threat:


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ATTEND
- WILL_NOT_* TALKS UNLESS +
\end{verbatim}
In this case, use \texttt{[134] (Threaten to halt negotiations)} instead of \texttt{[139]}.
\end{quote}

\item Codes such as \texttt{RECEIV} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{+ * SUPPORT FROM \$} produce miscodes because they can be so many different ones: \texttt{[070]}, \texttt{[051]}, etc. Add (the minimally needed number of) words to give such vague phrases context.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
RECEIV
- + * FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM \$ [071]
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\item Especially with problematic verbs like strike, always be sure to include necessary contextual information.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
SAID WOULD * AGAINST +
\end{verbatim}
This could be \texttt{[138] (threaten with military force)} or \texttt{[133] (threaten with political dissent).}
Instead, make the code
\begin{verbatim}
SAID WORKERS WOULD GO_ON_* AGAINST + [133]
\end{verbatim}
to erase the ambiguity.
\end{quote}

\item Restoring diplomatic relations is coded as \texttt{[050:050] (Engage in diplomatic cooperation)}, but establishing diplomatic relations is coded as \texttt{[054:054] (Grant diplomatic recognition)}.

\item When Peacekeepers arrive and are received, it is a reciprocal event: \texttt{[074:0861]}.

\item Use \texttt{[175] (Use tactics of violent repression)}, instead of \texttt{[173] (Impose curfew)}, for events where protesters/demonstrators/etc. are arrested, as we are capturing the fact that the government is using repression to restore order.

\item Adding nouns as verbs gets messy. Try to avoid this at all cost.

\item When in doubt, consult the CAMEO or TABARI codebook!

\item Whenever sensible, file a verb pattern under the \emph{first} verb to appear in the pattern. The first verb in a pattern is almost always the conjugated verb.


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ATTACK
- PROMIS TO_*
PROMIS
- * TO_ATTACK
\end{verbatim}
These two verb patterns are essentially identical---there's no reason to have both. However, the second is preferable, because it will be read first in a sentence. Hence, if we have the sentence ``\texttt{Gondor promised to attack Mordor with tanks}'', and the verb pattern
\begin{verbatim}
PROMIS
- * TANKS [1384]
\end{verbatim}
the second verb pattern will overwrite the third, but the first pattern will not.
\end{quote}
